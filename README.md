# Classifying-the-type-of-Cancer
 This is a Machine Learning Model that can help to classify the type of Breast Cancer

 I have achieved 94% accuracy while testing the model. The classifer used is Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) classifier.
I have utilized Scikit learn and inbuilt Wisconsin database of Breast Cancer which has 569 entries of Classification. The dataset includes various information about breast cancer tumors, as well as classification labels of malignant or benign. The dataset includes information on 30 attributes, or features, such as the radius of the tumor, texture, smoothness, and area. I used 33% of the data for testing while kept 77% of the same for training.
The notebook contains the code in Python and can be opened and tested on an enviornment.
